### RDA-landscape-genetics
-------------------

This repository gathers code that uses Redundancy Analysis (RDA) to analyze genomic data in a landscape genetics context.

1. RDA_landscape_genomics.html is a tutorial of the various RDA-based approaches reviwed in XX (DOI: XX)

2. RDA_landscape_genomics.R is the script used to conduct the analyses and produce the figures of the study described in XX (DOI: XX)

3. The Lodgepole pine data used for the different analyses come from Mahony, Colin et al. (2019), Data from: Evaluating genomic data for management of local adaptation in a changing climate: a lodgepole pine case study, Dryad, Dataset, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.56j8vq8
